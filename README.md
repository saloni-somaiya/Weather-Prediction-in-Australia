# Weather-Prediction-in-Australia

In this assignment I have worked on 'Weather Prediction Dataset' to predict Humidity3pm using linear regression and classify RainTomorrow using Logistic Regression. The dataset contains around 100000+ records with 15 features. 

I have applied cross validation to make sure my model is not overfitting for all three linear regression,logistic regression and step wise method. I have also tried to introduce bias on the regression line by introducing L2 regularization towards the end.
